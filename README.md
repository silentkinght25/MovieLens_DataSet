# MovieLens_DataSet

The main objective of this project is to analyse the data and create a movie recommender system. <br>
Going in detailed, this project will walk through the steps importing python libraries, loading data into dataframe, optimising dataframe, data manipulation. <br>

We will divide our work in following categories:<br>
<ol> 
  <li> <strong>Data Analysis</strong></li>
    <ul>
      <li> <strong> Descriptive statistcs:</strong> provide ground knowldege about the features and relations within the dataset </li>
      <li> <strong> Visualization:</strong> good for overview & understanding underlying relation between data using dynamic plots like         plotly and seaborn, and creating wordcloud. </li> 
    </ul> <br>
  <li><strong>Building Movie Recommendation System</strong></li>
    <ul>
      <li>Loading Raw Data in a seperate notebook</li>
      <li>Creating a pivot table in batches and appending the dataframe for optimisation and analysing what possible error one can     
          get</li>
      <li>Computing correlation between columns of data</li>
      <li>Cleaning up the final movie suggestions</li>
    </ul>
</ol>

GroupLens Research has collected and made available rating data sets from the MovieLens web site (https://movielens.org). The dataset I’m downloading and using is the “**MovieLens 25M Dataset**” which includes 25 million reviews. The data sets were collected over various periods of time with the most recent data from 2019.<br>

* <strong>MovieLens 25M Dataset:</strong> 25 million ratings and one million tag applications applied to 62,000 movies by 162,000 users (size: 250MB). It can be downloaded from link: https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/25m/
* <strong>MovieLens 10M Dataset:</strong> 10 million ratings and 100,000 tag applications applied to 10,000 movies by 72,000 users (size: 63MB). It can be downloaded from link: https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/10m/
